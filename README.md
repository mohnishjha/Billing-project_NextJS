This is a Frontend Billing Project based on Figma(https://www.figma.com/file/KE6wroedocVQSSW7BGd9AZ/invoice-app?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=CG8L2o4mSB0piXK3-0)

It is still a work in progress, and I am uploading it just in case I lose data on my system. So if you are trying to fork or clone, do know that it still needs a lot of work. 

Note: Right now the App is not responsive and will only work in mobile sized screens.

I have used NextJS and Tailwind to build it upon and I will be integrating Firebase for authentication and realtime database.
I may use Redux for state management but for now I am going with Context Api.


Feedback, Suggestions and Advices are always welcomed with gratitude üòäüôè

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
